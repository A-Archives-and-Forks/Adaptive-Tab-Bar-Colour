# Adaptive Tab Bar Color
Change the color of Firefox tab bar to match the website theme  

Every time you switch tabs, this add-on changes the tab bar color of your Firefox browser to match the theme color of the website you are viewing â€“ just like how macOS Safari tints its tab bar.

This add-on works well with websites with built-in dark mode and also supports
